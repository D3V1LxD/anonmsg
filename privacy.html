        <h1>Privacy Policy for AnonMsg</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: May 25, 2025</em></p>

        <p>Welcome to AnonMsg! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website AnonMsg.com and use our anonymous messaging service.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect on the Site includes:</p>
        
        <h3>Personal Data</h3>
        <p>Personally identifiable information, such as your username, email address, and hashed password, that you voluntarily give to us when you register with the Site. Messages you send are end-to-end encrypted, meaning we cannot read them; only the intended recipient (who has the correct password to decrypt their private key) can.</p>
        
        <h3>Anonymous Messages</h3>
        <p>Messages sent through our platform are designed to be anonymous from the sender's perspective and are end-to-end encrypted. While the recipient can view the message content after decryption, the sender's identity is not revealed to the recipient through our service. The encrypted messages are stored on our servers until deleted by the recipient.</p>

        <h3>Derivative Data</h3>
        <p>Information our servers automatically collect when you access the Site, such as your IP address (for security and rate-limiting purposes only, not linked to messages sent anonymously), your browser type, your operating system, your access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the Site. This data is used for system administration and to improve our services and is generally not personally identifiable.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Site to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and manage your account.</li>
            <li>Deliver anonymous messages as per the service functionality.</li>
            <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the Site.</li>
            <li>Prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor against theft, and protect against criminal activity.</li>
            <li>Resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.</p>
        <p>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
            <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of AnonMsg.</li>
            <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service.</li>
            <li>Protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.</li>
            <li>Protect against legal liability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. We implement end-to-end encryption for messages, meaning only the recipient can decrypt and read them. User passwords are hashed before storage. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, or until you request deletion of your account. Encrypted messages are retained until the recipient deletes them through their dashboard.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Your Privacy Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Account Information: You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your account by logging into your account settings or contacting us.</li>
            <li>Messages: Recipients can delete messages they receive via their dashboard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Policy for Children</h2>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
